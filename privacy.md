Hive Open Media Privacy Policy

Introduction

Hive Open Media is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our open-source social media platform.

Information We Collect

Personal Information: We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us, including your name, email address, and profile information.

Content Data: You can create, upload, or share content such as text, images, and videos. The privacy of this data is controlled by your selected privacy settings within the app.

Usage Data: We collect anonymized data on how you interact with the app to improve our service.

Integration Data: If you choose to integrate with Google Drive, we access files and folders necessary to provide our services, based on your permissions.

User-Controlled Privacy Settings

Data Visibility: You can set the visibility of your content and personal information to public, private, or custom groups, determining who can view or interact with your data.

Data Access: You control which parts of your data are stored on Google Drive and manage the access permissions directly through your Google Drive settings.

Communication Preferences: You can choose how we communicate with you, including opting out of non-essential notifications.

Use of Your Information

Service Provision: Your information is used to provide, operate, and maintain the app.

Improvement and Personalization: We analyze usage patterns to improve our services and personalize your experience.

Legal Compliance: We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect the rights and safety of our users and the public.

Data Security

We implement robust security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, and loss. However, no internet transmission is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Third-Party Services

Our app integrates with third-party services like Google Drive. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy

Hive Open Media is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes to our practices. We will notify you of any significant changes and obtain your consent where required.
